            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>REASONS Humbly offered For Passing the Bill for Encouragement and Improvement of the Manufacture of English Sail-Cloth.</head>
            <p>IT is not many Years since the <hi>French</hi> had the sole Trade of making Sailcloth, and furnished both <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> with that Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity; 'till in the Time of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, that <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> making War upon <hi>Holland,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King prohibited the selling or sending any of his Canvas to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who were thereupon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to set it up for themselves; and have in that Time brought it to so great Perfection, as not only to supply their own Shipping with that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, but also to furnish this Kingdom with the same to the yearly Amount of 200000 <hi>l.</hi> and upwards. That about Five or Six Years ago, upon En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement given by Act of Parliament, that Manufacture was attempted to be set up here; and has so well succeeded in that Time, by the Care and Industry of the Undertakers, that if a further Encouragement were given to it, it would in all probability equal if not exceed the <hi>Hollands Duck.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Benefit arising to this Kingdom by propagating this most useful Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture, amongst many others that might be enumerated, are chiefly these:</p>
            <p n="1">I. It employs already a very great Number of our Poor in Beating, Heckling, Spinning, and Weaving. That of every Hundred Pounds employed in making this Commodity, Three parts in Four goes out in Labour; so that if 200000 <hi>l.</hi> which by a moderate Compute is the yearly Import of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity from <hi>Holland,</hi> were spent at Home, amongst our own Poor 150000 <hi>l.</hi> of that would go in Ease of the great Charge and Burden we are at in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of them.</p>
            <p n="2">II. If this Manufacture were Encouraged, great Quantities of Hemp and Flax would be sown in several Parts of this Kingdom, and a further Help by that means given towards the Imployment of our Poor.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:171488:2"/>
            <p>
               <hi>England</hi> making War upon <hi>Holland,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King prohibited the selling or sending any of his Canvas to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who were thereupon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to set it up for themselves; and have in that Time brought it to so great Perfection, as not only to supply their own Shipping with that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, but also to furnish this Kingdom with the same to the yearly Amount of 200000 <hi>l.</hi> and upwards. That about Five or Six Years ago, upon En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement given by Act of Parliament, that Manufacture was attempted to be set up here; and has so well succeeded in that Time, by the Care and Industry of the Undertakers, that if a further Encouragement were given to it, it would in all probability equal if not exceed the <hi>Hollands Duck.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Benefit arising to this Kingdom by propagating this most useful Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture, amongst many others that might be enumerated, are chiefly these:</p>
            <p n="1">I. It employs already a very great Number of our Poor in Beating, Heckling, Spinning, and Weaving. That of every Hundred Pounds employed in making this Commodity, Three parts in Four goes out in Labour; so that if 200000 <hi>l.</hi> which by a moderate Compute is the yearly Import of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity from <hi>Holland,</hi> were spent at Home, amongst our own Poor 150000 <hi>l.</hi> of that would go in Ease of the great Charge and Burden we are at in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of them.</p>
            <p n="2">II. If this Manufacture were Encouraged, great Quantities of Hemp and Flax would be sown in several Parts of this Kingdom, and a further Help by that means given towards the Imployment of our Poor.</p>
            <p n="3">III. In case it should hereafter happen that we should have a War with <hi>Holland,</hi> we should by this means be in a Condition to supply our selves at Home with that Essential part of Naval Stores which we are now depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant upon <hi>Holland</hi> for.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. We might not only by this means help our selves upon all Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, but by an equal Distribution in our Exports of that Commodity, be able to supply our own Plantations with it; and of what Advantage that would be to <hi>England</hi> in this Juncture, is pretty plain and obvious.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>'Tis therefore humbly hoped, upon these Considerations, this Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble House will not suffer such an Useful and Beneficial Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture to be lost, but will Pass the Bill that now lies before them for the further Encouragement and Improvement of it.</hi>
